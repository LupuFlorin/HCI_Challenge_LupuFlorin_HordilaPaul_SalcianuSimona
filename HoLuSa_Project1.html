    <h3>Business Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Since Sara is a marketing manager, her business goals may not directly apply to the group travel experience. However, it's worth considering the potential benefits that the mobile application can bring to businesses involved in the tourism industry, such as:
</li>
        <li>Increased Customer Satisfaction: A user-friendly and efficient mobile application can enhance the overall customer satisfaction of group tourists. This, in turn, can benefit businesses by receiving positive reviews, recommendations, and repeat bookings.
</li>

  <h1>Interaction design patterns:</h1>

     <p>Regarding the desktop application, the agency, the main page from where we can select the menu, the map, the contact and the settings.</p>
     <p>By a simple click on the menu we access the page where we have the options:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Home - which returns to the main page</li>
        <li>Make trip - create a new trip</li>
        <li>Send to Users - send trip details to users </li>
        <li>Settings - access the settings</li>
     </ul>

     <p> By clicking on the "Make a trip" button we access the page where we select the city and we type in the details about the trip such as the attractions, the departure hour and the arrival hour. </p>
     <p> For the attraction, deprture hour and the arrival hour we simply type in the hour. </p>
     <p >When all the details are established, we send these details about the trip further to the users.</p>

     <p>Regarding the mobile application, we have the main page from where we can select the menu, the chat, the available trips, the schedule and the ongoing trip.</p>
     <p>By clicking on the "Chat" button we access the chat page where we can talk to other users or the driver.</p>
     <p>The "Available trips" page is where the user select the trip that he wants. By clicking on the trip he can see the schedule, the map and can decide if he want to select it or not. By clicking on the map the user is redirected to the map that he can see by dragging it.</p>
     <p>The "Trip schedule" page is the extended program for the users.</p>
     <p>The "Ongoing trip" button redirects the user to Mike, his personal guide who tells him useful and interesting things about the visited place but also counts the timer and the time when he has to go to the next tourist attraction. Here we have used an animation with pre-set messages, but they cannot be modified by clicking, nor can you communicate with the "guide" Mike to ask him things.</p>
     <p>The "Home" button is present on each page precisely to make it easy for the user to return to the main page any time. </p>
 
    <p>The "Menu" show details about the logged in user and has also the option to change the settings.</p>
    <h2>Here are the storyboards based on which the two platforms were designed.</h2>
    <img src="./Storyboards/tourist-helping-app---desktop-version-highres.png" alt="The desktop version" width="500" height="600">
    
    <img src="./Storyboards/tourist-helping-app---mobile-version-highres.png" alt="The mobile version" width="500" height="600">

    <h2>And also the user flows.</h2>
    <img src="./User Flows/Tourist helping app flow - Desktop version.jpg" alt="The desktop version" width="500" height="300">
    
    <img src="./User Flows/Tourist helping app flow - Mobile version.jpg" alt="The mobile version" width="500" height="300">
    
   <h2>Affective factors and emotions.</h2>
   <p>Emotion is a reaction to events deemed relevant to the needs, goals, or concerns of an user.</p>
   <p>Keeping a user happy may, therefore, not only affect satisfaction, but may also lead to efficiency and creativity. To stimulate emotions, products must have attributed a personality based on appearance and interaction means.</p>
   <p>That is precisely why the mobile version is very easy to use, interfaces directly address the basic needs of a certain user. It also benefits from a pleasant visual experience, the pages being colorful ,also like the map. In addition to the predominant colors, on the visual side we also use icons that are suggestive of actions.</p>
    
   <p>Affective computing in Human-Computer Interaction involves developing technologies that can recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions in order to enhance the user's experience and improve the effectiveness of the interaction. The goal of affective computing in HCI is to create computer systems that can understand and adapt to human emotions, leading to more personalized and engaging user experiences.</p>
   <p>Here are some techniques and technologies used in affective computing:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Emotion recognition:sensor bracelet </li>
    <li>Emotion modeling</li>
    <li>Emotion expression:animated avatars, voice modulation </li>
    <li>Emotion-driven adaptation: providing calming music when detecting signs of stress, for example when reaching a difficult level of a game  </li>   

</ul>

    <p>To create emotion and a more relaxed space we have Mike, the personal guide.</p>
    <p>Its mission is to tell the user interesting information about the tourist sights visited, but also to keep track of the time spent at a location, informing the user when it is time to leave for the next location.</p>
    <p>Even if it is not made in such a way as to answer questions, the interactive guide is a method of bringing emotion through the simple animation itself and through the messages transmitted which do not necessarily only have an educational role but also a fun role to learn new information.</p>

    <h1><font color="blue">Context of use</font></h1>
    <p>In the current case, the context of use of the suggested application is to make it easier for students in terms of the accessibility of navigation in the city, as well as offering solutions for people who have disabilities and do not have the necessary conditions to carry out their activity.</p>
    <p>
        During the exploration, we discovered the fact that there are certain problems that can affect the efficiency of some simple problems in a student's life, but that can be solved by implementing simple solutions that can make a difference.
        Most of the problems are related to the nature of the transport, the conditions offered being sometimes insufficient, but what we noticed more strongly is the fact that students with disabilities are deprived of certain things that help them in carrying out their daily activities, such as disabled ramps, elevators and the presence of many scales within the faculty.
    </p>

    <h1><font color="blue">Main audience</font></h1>
    <p>Given the above problems, we focused on creating an application that can come up with a solution for some problems, our main audience being students, students who use their personal car to get to faculty and students with disabilities.</p>

    <h1><font color="blue">Empiric laws</font> </h1>
    <h3> Fitts' law is an effective  method of modeling user performance in rapid, aimed movements, where one appendage (like a hand) starts at rest at a specific start position, and moves to rest within a target area.</h3>
    <p>Its principles are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Things done more often should be assigned a larger button</li>
        <li>Things done more often should be closer to the average position of the user's cursor</li>
        <li>The top, bottom, and sides of the screen are infinitely targetable because of the boundary created by the edges of the screen</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The application must be as intuitive and easy to use as possible. A very good example would be the use of a main menu with redirection to the student who prefers public transport / the student who uses his personal car and the student with disabilities. Each of this category will have presented the options provided by the application</p>
    <p>In the section "Student who prefers public transport", we will have representative buttons for the map of public transport and the option to reserve a place where a short questionnaire will be used with: the departure station and the selection of the preferred departure time</p>
    <p>In the section "Student who uses his personal car,we will have representative buttons for the map that will select the shortest route and the possibility of reserving a parking space in the parking lot specially arranged for students by entering the student identification number. If there are no parking spaces available, the student will be notified with "No parking space available" and will automatically be presented with the option to search for a parking space near the faculty."</p>
    <p>In the section "Student with disabilities,we will have representative buttons for asking a colleague for help. There will be 2 fields to enter the current location and the destination and also the option to reserve a place identical to the questionnaire in the section Student who prefers public transport".</p>
    <p>Registration in the application to help colleagues in need will be done on the basis of a questionnaire with name/surname/email address or phone number/faculty/student identification number. Each registered student will receive a notification either by SMS or email and the one who accepts the request for help will have a simple button that will notify the student with disabilities that his request has been accepted and in the shortest time the Name + Surname colleague  will come to help.</p>
    <p>Once the selected profile is selected, it will remain selected, but it can be changed at any time from the main menu. Also, the route used most often will be saved to favorites after a few uses of it, valid both for the route of the student who prefers public transport and for the student who prefers the car.</p>

    <h3>Hick’s Law states that the more choices a person is presented with, the longer the person will take to reach a decision.</h3>
    <p>There are exceptions to Hick’s Law. For one, it applies only to equally probable choices, where the user is equally likely to select any of the choices. This means that if users already know what they want to do before seeing the list of choices, the time it takes them to act is likely to be less than what Hick’s Law describes.</p>
    <p>From the moment the student selects his profile, the list of available options is not very large, and the fact that he already knows for what purpose he is using the application, whether he wants to reserve a seat in a means of transport, or whether he wants to find a faster route to college/a parking space or need help, the reaction time is instant.</p>

    <h3>The Steering law suggests that the size and location of graphical targets in an interface can significantly affect the ease and efficiency with which users can interact with them.</h3>
    <p>In practice, this means that designers should strive to create interfaces with larger and more accessible targets, such as buttons, sliders, and other interactive elements. By making these elements easier to select and interact with, designers can reduce the time required for users to complete tasks and improve overall user experience.</p>

    <p>All three of these laws are important in the design of interfaces and interactive systems, as they can inform decisions about the size and placement of targets, the number of options presented to users, and the overall complexity of the interface. By understanding these principles, designers can create interfaces that are more efficient, intuitive, and easy to use, thing we try as much as possible through the simplicity of the menu and the options we provide.</p>
    <h1><font color="blue">Usability problems of various physical and digital things of interest</font></h1>
    <h2>Primary type:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lack of parking spaces or specially arranged parking lots near the faculty</li>
        <li>Inability to use the only elevator available in the faculty due to crowding</li>
        <li>The lack of several access roads to the classrooms, as the main stairs are often crowded and there is no streamlining of their use</li>
        <li>The lack of a mean of public transport specially designed for students, useful especially during rush hours, to avoid traffic</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Secondary type:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The lack of access ramps for students with disabilities</li>
        <li>The lack of a special elevator for disabled people, especially due to the fact that there are only stairs leading to the classrooms</li>
        <li>The fact that there is no access way in the faculty that does not include stairs, with the exception of the back entrance, which is also reached via a road with stairs</li>
        <li>The lack of an electronic panel indicating the classrooms, useful especially for first-year students</li>
    </ol>

    <h1><font color="blue">How could metaphors/idioms, affordances, and visual variables be used?</font></h1>
    <h2>Metaphors and idioms</h2>
    <p>
        Idioms and metaphors are effective literary tools used to communicate everyday.The elevator for example of an effective mataphor. Learning how to use it is effortless and memorable.
        There are no tutorials for using it. We don’t understand the technical functionality of the elevator perfectly, but we use it almost everyday. This is metaphoric and idiomatic learning.
    </p>
    <p>The icons used in the application will be intuitive, representing a means of public transport / a car / a person with disabilities, precisely to make the selection obvious.</p>
    <h2>Affordances</h2>
    <p>
        Affordances resonate with designers concern about making possible uses of their products immediately obvious. For instance, we can easily see the door handle or the stairs we have to climb to get to faculty, which we use correctly without thinking.
        Another intuitive example could be the elevator menu which can include strong clues, such as clickable buttons and tabs, draggable sliders, and spinnable controls, as well as other elements that more or less directly suggest suitable user actions.
    </p>
    <p>An example in our application is the menu consisting of three main profiles which then redirects the user to his area of interest.</p>
    <h2>Visual variables</h2>
    <p> We know  twelve visual variables more discussed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>location</li>
        <li>size</li>
        <li>shape</li>
        <li>orientation</li>
        <li>color hue</li>
        <li>color value,</li>
        <li>texture</li>
        <li>color saturation</li>
        <li> arrangement</li>
        <li>crispness</li>
        <li>resolution</li>
        <li>transparency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These visual variables can be used in the description of a transport application in rush hours and crowded areas, for highlighting the parts of the city that make traffic difficult and that would make it difficult to get to the faculty, color each public transport route differently, add an icon for each station, highlight the selected departure station in the case of a reservation and highlight the reserved parking space.
    </p>

    <h1><font color="blue">Solutions of real-life objects and/or software solutions of improvement </font></h1>
    <h1><font color="red">FindLoc App</font> </h1>
    <p>For example, we could create an application for students where they can access different fields such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a traffic map</li>
        <li>the possibility to reserve a seat in the means of transport used(especially for people with disabilities)- these reservations can be made at least 30 minutes before and require a confirmation 10 minutes before,otherwise it is cancelled</li>
        <li>a help platform also created for students with disabilities where different colleagues can log in daily and can be requested by them based on their location</li>
        <ul>
            <li>for example, if they want to get to the canteen and encounter an obstacle on the way, they can ask for help from a colleague</li>
            <li>or, in the situation where there are still no access ramps within the campus, they need a little help</li>

        </ul>
        <li>
            an access panel to the classrooms - this can be similar to the maps that describe the routes of public transport, all that is needed is a button where the class we are looking for is noted and it displays the route from the point where we are to the class, with additional information
            (floor, the name of the discipline that takes place in the respective room, along with the name of the teacher and the
            of the group present)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding the solutions of real-life objects here are some ideas: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>more functional elevators</li>
        <li>more access ramps</li>
        <li>less stairs</li>
        <li>a parking lot where access is based on the student ID</li>
        <li>more buses/trolleys for students during rush hours</li>

    </ul>

    <h1><font color="blue">The use of empirical laws of interaction, affordances, and flow</font></h1>
    <h3>Flow experience is the main variable for maintaining a long-lasting, sustainable relationship with the users.</h3>
    <p>The most determining factors of the users’ flow state are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the ease of use</li>
        <li>the type of content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Flow refers to the state of being fully immersed in an activity or experience. In the context of user experience design, flow refers to designing interfaces and experiences that allow users to become fully absorbed in what they are doing.
        This can be achieved by designing interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and engaging. By designing interfaces that facilitate flow, designers can help users to become more productive, engaged, and satisfied with the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, empirical laws of interaction, affordances and flow can inform the design of interfaces that are both efficient and enjoyable to use. By understanding the empirical laws of interaction, designers can create interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use. By incorporating affordances into the design, designers can make it easier for users to understand how to interact with an interface. Finally, by designing interfaces that induce flow, designers can create experiences that are engaging and satisfying for users.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of the flow, the biggest attraction is the fact that the application offers numerous solutions to ease the life of a student and encourage its use by the simple fact that in the need to find an easy route or to reserve a place in public transport/a parking space this idea comes in handy by reducing the time spent and the problems that may appear along the way. Not a few times it happened that traffic jams or the impossibility of taking a bus for the same reason represented an impediment to getting to faculty on time, and this application comes to the rescue with some simple but useful ideas.
        Regarding students with disabilities, it can be observed that there are not many easy ways for them and every time impediments may appear along the way, and the suggested solution is useful only by the simple fact that it highlights the help of their kind colleagues that is happening to be in the right place at the right time and are willing to do good.
